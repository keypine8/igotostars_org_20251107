This is a dump of all source for the project.
If you want to sell the html file as an app, go ahead - newabm.html.  It's a SINGLE HTML FILE containing C code (emscripten), jquery and all inline images used.  Once running in the browser (webkit) it never accesses the internet.  Saved as an HTML file and double clicked on, it runs fine without being connected to the internet.  It's responsive and runs on laptops, phones and tablets.  Down to 240 px width.  Stores birth information in local storage.

wide open source.
